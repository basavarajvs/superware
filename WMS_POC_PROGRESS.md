# WMS POC Project - Step-by-Step Progress Log

## Step 1: Environment Setup
- Created check_env.sh script to verify Java, Maven, and Docker installations
- Script location: /check_env.sh

## Step 2: Docker Configuration
- Created docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL and Keycloak services
- PostgreSQL: postgres:16 image, port 5432, credentials: wmsadmin/wmsadminpass
- Keycloak: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:25.0.2, port 8080, admin credentials: admin/admin123

## Step 3: Maven Project Structure
- Created multi-module Maven project with parent POM
- Structure: wms-poc (parent) -> common-libraries -> wms-tenant-context & wms-security-commons
- Java version: 21, Spring Boot version: 3.3.2

## Step 4: Multi-tenancy Implementation
- Created TenantContextHolder with ThreadLocal for tenant context storage
- Created TenantContextFilter to extract X-Tenant-ID header and manage context lifecycle
- Files located in common-libraries/wms-tenant-context module

## Step 5: OAuth2 Security Implementation
- Created wms-security-commons library with Spring Security configuration
- Implemented OAuth2 Resource Server with JWT validation
- Configured to validate tokens from Keycloak at http://localhost:8080/realms/wms-realm
- Added auto-configuration support through spring.factories

## Step 6: Library Build and Installation
- Successfully compiled and built both wms-tenant-context and wms-security-commons libraries
- Installed JAR files in local Maven repository
- Libraries ready for use as dependencies in microservices

## Step 7: Inventory Service Skeleton
- Created inventory-service Spring Boot microservice skeleton
- Added main application class InventoryServiceApplication with @SpringBootApplication
- Configured pom.xml with dependencies:
  - spring-boot-starter-web
  - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
  - PostgreSQL driver
  - wms-tenant-context library
  - wms-security-commons library
- Added spring-boot-maven-plugin for packaging
- Created application.yml with:
  - Server port 8082
  - PostgreSQL datasource configuration
  - JPA settings (ddl-auto: none, show-sql: true)

## Step 8: Shared-Schema Multi-tenancy Implementation
- Created TenantIdentifierResolver implementing Hibernate's CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver
- Configured Hibernate to use the tenant identifier resolver through application.yml
- Created sample InventoryItem entity with @Filter annotation for tenant filtering
- Added tenant_id column to the entity for shared-schema approach
- Implemented TenantFilterService to demonstrate manual filter enabling
- Created TenantAwareRepository as a base repository that automatically enables tenant filters
- Removed unnecessary HibernateConfig class and complex repository factory implementation
- Optimized configuration for shared-schema multi-tenancy approach
- Successfully compiled all multi-tenancy components
- Cleaned up unused repository implementation files

## Step 9: JPA Entities for Inventory Schema
- Created JPA entities for all inventory tables based on database schema
- Applied multi-tenancy filtering to all entities using @FilterDef and @Filter annotations
- Implemented proper relationships between entities
- Added all necessary constructors, getters, setters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods
- Entities created:
  - InventoryItem
  - InventoryTransaction
  - InventoryTransactionDetail
  - InventoryReservation
  - InventoryReservationDetail
  - InventoryAllocation
  - InventoryCount
  - InventoryCountDetail
  - InventoryAdjustment
  - InventoryAdjustmentDetail
  - InventoryPolicy
- Successfully compiled all entities with proper multi-tenancy support

## Step 10: Spring Data JPA Repositories for All Entities
- Created Spring Data JPA repositories for all 13 inventory entities
- Implemented transparent multi-tenancy with automatic tenant filtering
- Removed explicit tenant ID passing from repository methods
- Created base repository interface (InventoryRepository) extending JpaRepository
- Created individual repositories for each entity:
  - InventoryAdjustmentRepository
  - InventoryAdjustmentDetailRepository
  - InventoryAllocationRepository
  - InventoryCountRepository
  - InventoryCountDetailRepository
  - InventoryItemRepository
  - InventoryPolicyRepository
  - InventoryReservationRepository
  - InventoryReservationDetailRepository
  - InventoryTransactionRepository
  - InventoryTransactionDetailRepository
- All repositories automatically enable tenant filtering through TenantAwareRepository
- Updated service implementations to work with transparent multi-tenancy approach
- Successfully compiled all repositories and services

## Current Status
- Docker containers (PostgreSQL and Keycloak) running successfully
- Keycloak configured with wms-realm and wms-client
- Access token retrieval from Keycloak working via curl
- Maven libraries built and available in local repository
- Inventory service skeleton created with Spring Boot application class
- Inventory service configured with dependencies on internal libraries
- Shared-schema multi-tenancy implemented with automatic tenant filtering
- Multi-tenancy components successfully compiled
- Optimized for shared-schema approach with column-based tenant filtering
- Complete set of JPA entities created for inventory schema with multi-tenancy support
- All JPA entities successfully compiled without errors
- Spring Data JPA repositories created for all entities with transparent multi-tenancy
- All repositories successfully compiled with proper tenant filtering
